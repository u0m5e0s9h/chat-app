# Chat UI Layout - Day 1

## What was implemented today

- Created a static chat UI layout using HTML and CSS.
- Features include:
  - Fixed top bar with room title and back button.
  - Scrollable chat area with message bubbles aligned left/right based on sender.
  - Timestamps below each message.
  - Date separators between messages.
  - Static "Someone is typing..." indicator with animated dots.
  - Input field with "Send" button.
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile using Flexbox and media queries.

## How to run and test the app

1. Open the `chat.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. Verify the UI layout:
   - Top bar is fixed with room title and back button.
   - Chat messages appear with correct alignment and timestamps.
   - Date separators are visible between messages.
   - The "Someone is typing..." indicator is shown statically.
   - Input field and send button are visible at the bottom.
3. Resize the browser window or open on a mobile device to test responsiveness.
4. Interact with the input field and buttons (note: this is a static UI, no actual message sending functionality).

This completes the Day 1 Chat UI Layout implementation and testing instructions.
